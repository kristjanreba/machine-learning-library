# machine-learning-library

This repository includes implementations of some machine learning algorithms, using only numpy and matplotlib.

Currently included:
- Linear regression
- Polynomial regression
- Logistic regression
- K-means clustering

In the future, I intend to add:
- Random forest classifier
- SVD classifier
- K-nearest neighbours classifier
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- hierarhical clustering
